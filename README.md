smart-m3-vagrant
================
Vagrant + Puppet example for running Smart-M3

## Known Issues
Smart-M3 developers have the bad habit of replacing release files. 
This might break .deb file names in puppet manifest (that happened at least once).

## TODO List
[ ] automatically launch dbus, redsibd and sib-tcp
